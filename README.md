# Primary Voter Project- Oklahoma
In this project I compared voter turnout in two races in an Oklahoma primary with the number of registered voters in that party, 
registered voters in full, and estimated adult population. This was for a campaign in another party, trying to see what voters might be swayed to 
switch parties in the general election after their candidate lost. As such, it was focused on several races of interest in the primary, leading to a 
limited scope for expediency. This was a no-code data project, creating pivot tables in Excel. Just goes to show, for some data, simpler is simpler! 

<h3> Some Takeaways </h3>
<ul>
<li>More votes were cast for higher profile races (Senate), even though voters already had a ballot in hand. Something was keeping some voters 
(in every county!) from filling out their entire ballots.</li>
<li>The decision-making voters are such a small portion of the actual population in every county! First-time voters could be 
the most impactful demographic to target.</li>
<li>Some counties had narrow margins among candidates with dramatically different ideologies. This suggests those counties, 
although decidedly tilted towards one party, may still have significant numbers of swayable voters in the general election.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potential Further Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Expand the scope</b>: Include all races in this primary, expand into additional primary races</li>
<li><b>Add some sociological data</b>: Talk to people about what got them to the ballot or kept them home, 
what made them feel comfortable/uncomfortable filling out the entire ballot</li>
<li><b>Visualizations</b>: In this case, the campaign preferred speedy results to pretty results but imagine this data on a choropleth! What a fascinating visual that would be!</li>
</ul>
